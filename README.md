# Pre-Workshop Instructions

You will need to bring your own computer on the day of the workshop. 

Please ensure that the laptop is charged, as there may not be enough power outlets for everyone to charge their laptops at once.

Ensure that you have the appropriate version of Python installed, as well as the appropriate Python libraries.

You will need:

Python 3.0 or higher
Matplotlib
Numpy

You will also need a text editor for running the Jupyter notebook for the workshop. Visual Studios Code is recommended for this. 

You can run the version-testing.ipynb file in VS Code to make sure you have the appropriate libraries installed.
